        <h2>Shine Registry</h2>

        <p>
            Shine Registry is a platform for women starting businesses to ask for what they need in the style of a wedding registry. Because if you can ask for a gravy boat when you get married you should be able to ask for what you need when you start your company too. This includes non-monetary asks like social media engagement, network connections and skill-based volunteering for things like marketing or developer hours. All of these things listed are examples of what’s been fulfilled on <a href="https://www.shineregistry.com/" target="_blank">www.shineregistry.com</a> so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            Emily is the Founder/CEO of Shine Registry.<br>

        <h2>Exquisite Coloring</h2>
        <p>
            Exquisite Coloring is a collaborative art project Emily has been developing since 2017. It is inspired by the exquisite corpse drawing method, Chuck Close, and the solver tool in MS Excel.

        <h2>The Forge Fellowship</h2>
        <p>
            Emily is involved with the organizing and development of the Forge Fellowship, an effort that honors her friend Reese Neader. The Forge Fellowship trains students in core policy, organizing, and base-building skills, and provides one-on-one guidance from Roosevelt Institute Network staff and alumni as they build organizing capacity in their communities and launch policy projects. A small army of Reese's friends are working to make each of the Forge Fellows feel eight feet tall.
